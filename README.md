# CS7641-Project
##Georgia Tech Master Course:CS7641: Machine Learning  
> 1. Implemented K-mean and K-medoids clustering methods for image compression with compression ratio 10.3:1
> 2. Implemented a personalized movie recommendation system based on Netflix’s user’s profile.
> 3. Clustered documents with multinomial distribution based on word count and optimized the solution with EM algorithm
> 4. Implemented a prediction system for SP500 stock index using Hidden Markov Model
